{"title":"About","content":"I have over 7 years of experience as a front end developer. I'm passionate about coding and performance. Also, I want the whole team to be better than now. On a daily basis, I'm learning and increasing my knowledge of new technologies, even if it's not in my field such as back end, because there might be some new approaches. I should have a good eye for design, so I look at a lot of websites and apps to learn. Personally, I'd love to WebGL stuff because it has a ton of visual expressions on the Web, so I keep to make something with WebGL."}
